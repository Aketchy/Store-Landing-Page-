# Store-Landing-Page-
Design choices explanation 

I used Tailwind CSS for fast and clean responsive styling.

The page is fully responsive using CSS grid and media queries (via Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities).

I added a sticky header and a simple hero section to make the design visually appealing.

Each product card includes an image, name, description, and Shop Now button.

Color palette: Indigo and purple for a modern store vibe.
